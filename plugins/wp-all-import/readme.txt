WP All Import is an extremely powerful plugin that makes it easy to import any XML or CSV file to WordPress.

== Description ==

*“It's a wonderful plugin that does so much, so well that it's hard to list all of the features. But I'll tell you this, I was able to import the content of a pair of websites running the ModX CMS into a WordPress install in less than 30 minutes. No joke!”*  
**Alex Vasquez** - DigiSavvy Co-Founder & WordCamp Los Angeles Organizer

WP All Import has a four step import process and an intuitive drag & drop interface that makes complicated import tasks simple and fast.

There are no special requirements that the elements in your file must be laid out in a certain way. WP All Import really can import any XML or CSV file.

WP All Import can be used for everything from migrating content from a legacy CMS to WordPress to building a store with an affiliate datafeed to displaying live stock quotes or sports scores to building a real estate portal.
