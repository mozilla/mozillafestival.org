        <h2>How the MozFest Program Works</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        MozFest is built each year on core <b>"tracks",</b> which are clusters of topics and sessions that we believe have the greatest potential for innovation and empowerment with the web. <b>Each track is curated by "Space Wranglers",</b> who are thought-leaders and community organizers in that particular topic. The tracks are spread across the entire venue and are the <b>central programmatic focus of the festival.</b>
