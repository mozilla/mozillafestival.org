Interactive as you want to be engaging and activating your participants from the beginning, and getting them making and doing, rather than listening and watching. Inclusive by welcoming all ages, all experience levels and disciplines to participate.",

Once you have submitted your session, it will enter an open curation process on <a href=\"https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mozfest-program-2018\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. All information you submit here, apart from email and Twitter handle will be seen publicly. We do encourage collaboration on Github, but it is not mandatory.",
